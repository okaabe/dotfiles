<h2 align="center">AwesomeWM</h2>
There are two active branches on this repository, the master, which contains my rice and the default, the default one is just my attemps to clone the default look of i3wm. 

### Libraries
I actually don't use many libraries, i only use the default one of awesomewm (awful, ruled, naughty) and the bling (made by javacafe and his friends). I think i should make it clear that the bling that is in this repository is a minimal version of it (contains only the few things that i use daily).

## How it looks? 
Im kinda lazy, then i won't take a screenshot and put it here, then if you are interested on how it looks i think you should clone the repo and check it by yourself.

## Is it usable?
Honestly, i have no idea. Im the worst person to say if something is usable or not, but it at least this config works to me, i think thats what matter since nobody is going to use this config anyway.

# Requirements
You just need to have installed in your pc the git version of awesomewm and everything should work well... i hope...
